## Building Tetris Foundations

Investigate the [HTML5 canvas tag](http://www.html5canvastutorials.com/) to

- [ ] Build the 7 different Tetris game shapes.
- [ ] Display them somewhere on the canvas.
- [ ] Outline a separate gameplay area in the canvas.
- [ ] Allow the user to
[drag one of the shapes](https://jsfiddle.net/davidbarszczak/EnZEa/) from the
staging area to the game area.
  - [ ] As soon as the user lets go of the mouse button, the shape should start moving towards the bottom of the game area.
